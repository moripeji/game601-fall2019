        "RPS Redeux" is a new take on the classically-beloved game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, featuring modifications such as the implementation of playing cards, point systems, and an optional "Risk Round" in which players may place bets on their moves to increase their pool of points. Each modification in place in "RPS Redeux" specifically addresses the issues of fair play, lack of inclusivity, and lack of strategy found within the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. For more information, view the RPS Redeux rules and design document. "

        “Kanji Kiken” is a time-based, language-learning board game that tests players’ Japanese language skills and encourages them to devise their own play strategy in order to receive the most amount of points. With each consecutive play of Kanji Kiken, players constantly develop a stronger, reinforced comprehension of the Japanese language, while continuing to hone and adapt their playing strategies, devising their own set of “best practices” and “best ways to play” in order to gain the most amount of points. For more information, view the official "Kanji Kiken" rules.

        All you ever wanted was a baby sister. So, when your parents brought one home for you, you were thrilled! From that point on, you and your sister were inseperable. You shared all of your toys, drew pictures of the two of you together to decorate the walls of the house, and spent all of your time playing and talking together. However, your parents are starting to act strange. They're taking the pictures of the two of you down, removing your sister's toys from the house, and getting angry for no reason! Then, your sister vanishes. Is it just a nightmare, or is it something more?

        You are a “packer”- an individual that runs on battery packs. Due to governmental attempts to “cull” the packer population, production of battery packs has been halted altogether. Thus, for survival, you are forced to scavenge the packer city for lost battery packs.
        Your main objective is to collect batteries. With each collected battery, your charge level increases. But, beware the government's goonies! With each consecutive hit from an enemy monster or missile, your charge level depletes incrementally. To stay alive, you must collect batteries AND defeat the government's goons! If you defeat all three levels of this platformer, you not only survive the government's evil culling efforts, but you save the entirety of the packer population!
